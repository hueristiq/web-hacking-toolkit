## Installation

### Docker

Pull the image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull signedsecurity/web-hacking-toolkit
```

Run a container and attach a shell:

```bash
docker run \
	-it \
	--rm \
	--shm-size="2g" \
	--name web-hacking-toolkit \
	--hostname web-hacking-toolkit \
	-p 22:22 \
	-v $(pwd)/data:/root/data \
	signedsecurity/web-hacking-toolkit \
	/bin/zsh
```
### Docker Compose

Docker-Compose can also be used.

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
    web-hacking-toolkit:
        image: signedsecurity/web-hacking-toolkit
        container_name: web-hacking-toolkit
        hostname: web-hacking-toolkit
        stdin_open: true
        shm_size: 2gb # increase shared memory size to prevent firefox from crashing
        ports:
            - "22:22" # exposed for GUI support sing SSH with X11 forwarding
        volumes:
            - ./data:/root/data
        restart: unless-stopped
```

Build and run container:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Attach shell:

```bash
docker-compose exec web-hacking-toolkit /bin/zsh
```

### Build from Source

Clone this repository and build the image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/signedsecurity/web-hacking-toolkit.git && \
cd web-hacking-toolkit && \
make build-image
```

Run a container and attach a shell:

```bash
make run
```

## GUI Support

By default, no GUI tools can be run in a Docker container as no X11 server is available. To run them, you must change that. What is required to do so depends on your host machine. If you:

* run on Linux, you probably have X11
* run on Mac OS, you need Xquartz (`brew install Xquartz`)
* run on Windows, you have a problem

### Using SSH with X11 forwarding

Use X11 forwarding through SSH if you want to go this way. Run `start_ssh` inside the container to start the server, make sure you expose port 22 when starting the container: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:22:22 ...`, then use `ssh -X ...` when connecting (the script prints the password).
